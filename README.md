# Tamil-Normalization 📝

**Tamil-Normalization** is an open-source community-driven project to **standardize and normalize Tamil text**.
Our mission is to build tools, datasets, and models that can automatically convert **vernacular Tamil** (spoken/regional variations, casual script, social media usage) into **standard Tamil** (formal, grammatical, and widely understood form).

This project aims to help in:

* Improving **NLP tasks** for Tamil (translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, etc.)
* Supporting **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** and **STT (Speech-to-Text)** systems
* Preserving linguistic richness while ensuring computational usability
* Creating a **free, community-driven dataset and models**

---

## 🚀 Goals

1. Collect and normalize **vernacular → standard Tamil** pairs (manual + synthetic).
2. Train and fine-tune LLaMA (or other LLMs) on this data.
3. Build APIs and libraries for Tamil normalization.
4. Enable integrations into TTS, STT, and AI-powered tools.
5. Grow an **open Tamil NLP community**.

## 🌍 Community Vision

Tamil is one of the world’s oldest languages, but modern AI systems struggle with **colloquial usage**. Together, we can **bridge the gap** between spoken and written Tamil, making it more accessible in technology.
